# Star Wars Planet Comparator

This project was done in the start of 2020 as part of Udemy's "The Complete Web Developer In 2020: Zero To Mastery" course. It was made as a way to understand and start working with APIs. Therefore, it actually **works with the Star Wars API (swapi)** in order to **obtain some planets from the Star Wars' world and compare their characteristics side by side**.

It is a **single page application** created using **React**. It doesn't have any backend infrastructure.
